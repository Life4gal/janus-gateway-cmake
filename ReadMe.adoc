== Introduction
`janus`, but use `cmake` to manage the project.

This repository doesn't pretend to be more `modern` than `makefile`,
but there are many great `IDE`(s) that have far stronger support for `cmake` than for `makefile`.

This repository tries to make it possible for people who are not so familiar with `makefile` to get started with `janus` more quickly. (Of course, they need some familiarity with `cmake`) :)

== Features

== Requirements

Same requirements as `janus`, just follow the instructions in the official `janus` repository to install it.
